#A NOTE OF WARNING FOR ANY ONLOOKERS:
    #THIS IS A HOT MESS
    # I AM PRETTY MUCH STILL AT THE EXPERIMENTATION STAGE
    # DO NOT JUDGE THIS CODE


So i think it would be a good idea to have a way to deserialize can translations, that way if someone reverse
engineered their cars can bus, they could drop in the file and a cmd dict could possibly be built out of the file

this makes the software widely extensible since now anyone can drop in can definitions for their cars

    # data processing
    # recieve a message
    # pop into queue
    # log with timestamp

    # process messages
    # get first message in queue list
    # remove from queue
    # perform calcs
    # display/log
    
    #the carSim is good for testing, but will ultimately be fleshed out fully as a full replayer


    #average time between messages appears to be one ms
    #currently we have to just guess what the packet ID may be. this honestly may be fine
    #but if time starts becoming an issue we can order the packets by frequency
    # Primary goal is not to sacrifice packets.    
    # connection.shutdown_can_interface()
    
    
    
    I will be adding back the command pattern from the if else. I figured out how to pass parameters to the dict functions
